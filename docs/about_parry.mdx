**Parry** is a set of 2D and 3D collision-detection libraries written using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
It targets applications requiring fast geometric operations like distance computation, contact generation, intersection
tests, etc. It also supports mesh transformations like convex-hull computation and approximate convex decompositions.

Parry is free and open-source, released under the Apache 2.0 license. It is developed by the [Dimforge](https://dimforge.com)
open-source company. You can support us by sponsoring us on [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/dimforge).
